It is one thing to wish for the bank account of rich even though you know you'll be depressed nonetheless, it's another to think the money would solve your problems (or depression). We know money can solve some problems. There has even been extensive research which shows that money\u2014up to a certain amount\u2014does help alleviate a lot of problems for most people.

No one can explain what love truly is, and yet, we place our entire beings on the concept, the idea, of love. We see this in literature, religion, history. Wars were fought because of love and jealousy, real wars where millions have lost their lives; people taking their own lives when love was lost, etc. If you collect all of literature that has been dedicated to love or were sprung out of love, it seems to me to be the map of a collective illness. </p> <p>Because for most part, we don't have very good reason to fall in love with somebody. It's always described as a look, a touch or just a few words said in a situation or place where you didn't expect it, and people then runs off chasing that other and risking their entire lives for it. </p> <p>And yet, we often end up fall out of love with the same person for the same reasons we fell in love with them. There's some sort of poetic irony in this. </p> <p>Humans is said to thrive on the chase, rather than when they achieve the goal, it seems to bleed over to the realm as well. We love the thrill of not knowing whether or not the other is thinking of us, of whether or not the other saw our message and then cry in agony when we're left \"on read\" (or in olden times, the many ways a letter could be lost but the result were the same). </p> <p>The heart always wants what it can't get, and prefers the insanity of not knowing over the stability of having, and knowing.

If I could only agree with the idea that life is absurd, I'd shrug the rest off of my shoulders and then continue living and stops asking any further questions about it.

Which, if you ask Camus', is also only absurd becase of comparison. I compare my life to others, who seem to live a more \"normal\" life and hence wonder why i can't be similar to them. I look at my friends who settle down and think, that would bore me to hell and it would be true torture; yet I cannot shake the voice in my mind which says: but why can't you just be a little more like them? Why not make life easier for yourself, when it is already hard? \u2013 Because there's no meaning in the simple.

This is the absurd tragedy: For them to be together, one of them has to be destroyed. </p> <p>Philosophical suicide: not an actual suicide, but mere surrender to a leap of faith (so to speak).

1\u2014Why Does It Matter That Nothing Matters","text":"\"I Honor Nihilism\" <p>Nihilism is the righteous and honorable resistance of a people crushed under an iron rule. Nihilism is evidence of life ... The last weapon of victims choked and manacoled beyond all other resistance.\" \u2014Wendell Philips</p> <p>Nihilism is one of those concepts that we are all pretty sure we know the meaning of unless someone asks us to define it. </p> <p>Nihil means \"nothing\" -ism means \"ideology\".</p> <p>Combining these two terms gives \"ideaology of ntohing\", which seemingly seems to refute itself. To say that this means someone \"believes in nothing\" is not really much more helpful; as believing in something suggests there is something to be believed in, but if that something is nothing then there is not something to be believed in (in which case, believing in nothing is again a self-refuting idea).</p> Doing Nothing <p>The question is this: What have I been doing? Everybody says to me, \"Hey you don't do the show anymore, what do you do?\" I'll tell you waht I do: Nothing. Doing Nothing is not as easy as it looks. You have to be careful. Because the idea of doing anything, which could easily lead to doing something, that would cut into your nothing, and that would force me to have to drop everything.\" \u2014Jerry Seinfeld</p> <p>Nothingness quickly becomes somethingness as soon as we try to talk about it; and yet we talk about it all the time. \"What have you been up to?\" - \"Nothing.\" Exchanges like this are so common that it has become something of a reflex, as we frequently respond to such mundane questions. </p> <p>To most people an answer like this would not be an example of nihilism, since nihilism is suposed to be something dark, something negative, something destructive.  Saying you're doing nothing, is perfectly normal because everyone knows that you are not literally doing nothing, but are simply indicating that you are doing nothing worth mentioning. </p> <p>However, if humans have these sorts of exchanges as frequently as indicated in the book by Nolen Gertz, Nolen states that that must mean we are frequently spending our time doing nothing worth mentioning. </p> <p>And if humans were actually spending so much time doing nothing worth mentioning, then perhaps this exchange is closer to what nihilism actually is. Nolen Gertz states that perhaps this does indicate that our lives are not worth mentioning, that we are doing nothing with our lives; that we are nothing, that we believe in nothing.</p> <p>To believe in nothing </p> <p>To believe in nothing in this sense would then require not that we have a specific believe about nothingness that we could identify, but instead that we are living lives that accord with the belief that life is nothing.</p> <p>Nihilism as an \"ideology of nothing\" would mean not that e adhere to a discernible system of believes about nothingness, but rather that the beliefs we have, or think we have, are equivalent to nothing.</p> <p>To be self-righteous is to see what is normal, what is accepted, what is popular as nihilistic, as nothing, as meaningless. But to accuse others of being nihilistic is to be seen by those others as the oe who is truly nihilstic. </p> <p>Note: there are nihilating tendencies practiced by the nihilists and there are the nihilating tendencies practiced by the self-righteous. </p> <p>How to explain this in simpler terms: if you complain that others have no meaning in their lives, because what they care about; i.e shopping or eating a very good meal, is nihislistic\u2014without meaning\u2014 then this reveals yourself as the nihilistic one because you don't think anything beholds an inherent meaning. (Why is there confusion in this? This is probably more or less known to the nihilistic person themselves, which most likely might be the reason they are searching for one; or does Gertz mean to say that most nihilistic are unaware of it themselves? \u2013 which seems wrong to me considering Gertz stresses the importance of asking questions, but perhaps that's the anti-nihilstic behaviour he's looking for in the nihilistic.)</p> <p>Self-righteous vs nihilstic: Both are similar insofar they are destructive, but they are opposed in the manner of methods and purpose of their desctructiveness:</p> <p>The self-righteous often wages war with the general society, but such war are often short-lived, if they happen at all due to the mere fact that they would simply be ignored (or wiped out by the sheer numbers, as the self-righteous would be the part with lesser number). However, when the self-righteous discover that their confrontation seldom leads to the revolution they are hoping for, they'll turn to whatever media that are available to them: traditional media are replaced by social media and shouting ([[Studying nihilism\u2014mental health#note| but has it though]]).</p> <p>Nolen Gertz postulates that \"questioning the quo[[Studying nihilism\u2014mental health#Questioning the status quo | has become the status quo]].\"</p> <p>In a seemingly self-righteous society nihilists has therefore gained considerable popularity, and there's some comedic irony to this. Nihilism has then become a some sort of \"charge\" to be used against anyone who isn't supporting the right morale, but Gertz asks how this is possible when these two philisophies are seemingly on the opposite side of each other? Gertz concludes in this chapter that in doing so we might be taking meaningfulness for granted, and that to answer the question of what nihilism is; we have to leave open whether or not anything in life is actually meaningful. </p>"},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Gertz%2C%20Nolen/Nihilism/Chapter%201%E2%80%94Why%20Does%20It%20Matter%20That%20Nothing%20Matters/#philosophy-nihilism","title":"Philosophy #Nihilism","text":""},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Gertz%2C%20Nolen/Nihilism/Chapter%202%E2%80%94History%20Of%20Nihilism/","title":"Chapter 2\u2014History Of Nihilism","text":"<p>In this chapter, Gertz presents a curated list of philosophers dating back to ancient Greece who, despite not being the one's using the phrase nihilism themselves, were among those whose arguments has since become the foundation of what is known as nihilism today. </p> <p>The word nihilism itself dates back to 18th Century, to debates that took place among German philosophers over the implications of the metaphysics of Enlightenment. However, Gertz notes that the history of what nihilism represents can be trace back even further, and he that indeed Socrates himself was not only the father of philosophy, but also the father of self-righteousness. </p> <p>Indeed, Socrates would ask Athenians to define concepts that were central to everyday life, such as love, honour, piety, knowledge and justice. However, once a fellow Athenian gave him an answer, Socrates would test the definition given to him. He would not only challenge the Athenians to prove that what they believed to be true could actually withstand any and all attempts at refutation but also challenge them to admit that their beliefs were false if Socrates refutations were successful. In other words, Nolen writes, that Socrates went beyond merely trying to engage members of society in debate, as he was trying to force Athenians to questions the beliefs their society was built upon; to question whether their society was based on the solid foundation of knowledge or on dubious [[Studying nihilism\u2014mental health#2025 and this hasn't changed | foundations like custom and opinion]].</p>"},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Gertz%2C%20Nolen/Nihilism/Chapter%202%E2%80%94History%20Of%20Nihilism/#socrates-cave","title":"Socrates' Cave","text":"<p>Nolen's re-telling of the history of nihilism begins with Socrates' Cave: In Book VII, Socrates paints humans as prisoners who have been trapped in an underground cave since birth, with nothing to experience, nothing to learn and nothing to talk about; other than shadows. After describing this kind of life, Socrates declares: \"they are like us!\".</p> <p>He challenges his readers to seriously consider that everything they think they know about reality is an illusion. We are like the prisoners underground cave not only because we accept as reality whatever we have grown accustomed to but also because, having grown accustomed to this reality, we would reject any challenge to this reality that was presented to us. </p> <p>Nolen makes an argument that Socrates wants us to realise that we are nihilistic because Socrates maintains seeing is believe but also that believing is rejecting. </p> <p>According to Nolen, nihilism is a danger both epistemologically and existentially from a Socratic perspective \u2014 Socrates argues that the prisoners would not only continue to believe in shadows even if counterevidence was provided to them but would kill anyone who brought them this counterevidence; anyone who tried to convince them that their beliefs were false, anyone who tried to liberate them from their prison. The prisoners, not knowing that the are prisoners, would not see the cave as prison, but as home \u2013 just as the prisoners would not see the person who wants to take them out of the cave as a liberator but as a madman. </p> <p>Looking back at history, you could say Socrates was right, as he was accused by the greater Athenian society of being a heretic and a dangerous corruptor of the youth. One of the accusations Socrates faced was that he never put forward his own beliefs and instead merely [[Studying nihilism\u2014mental health#Asking questions equals attacking beliefs | tried to attack the belief of others]].</p> <p>There's this famous story of Socrates being told by the Oracle of Delphi that he, indeed was the wisest man of Athens because he alone knew that he knew nothing. Socrates' interlocutors likened him to a torpedo fish, a creature which numbs anyone who comes into contact with it; however Socrates instead likens himself to a gadfly and a midwife: suggesting that his purpose is not to confuse but to motivate and to help. </p> <p>He weakens people's certainty in their beliefs not to be evil but to inspire others to replace their beliefs with knowledge. As he himself says during his trial: \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". Socrates would rather die than to be sentenced to a life where his prohibited from asking questions in such manner. </p> <p>Nolen argues that Socrates embodies many of the characteristics of what's known as an anti-nihilist today, by eroding not only their faith in what they believe to be true but also in what they believe truth to be. He wanted people to be inspired by him, even those who comes to conclusions more radial than those of himself. </p>"},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Gertz%2C%20Nolen/Nihilism/Chapter%205%E2%80%94Where%20is%20nihilism/","title":"Chapter 5\u2014Where is nihilism","text":"<p>Between body and mind or people and place</p> <p>Nihilistic political systems</p> <p>Public political activity and swapped it fro commercial activity only</p> <p>The alarm that tells us that we do not belong in the world in which we find ourselves. </p> <p>Nihilism as something psychological or systemic </p>"},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Gertz%2C%20Nolen/Nihilism/Glossary/","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>[!col] Authenticity</p> <p>[!col-md-3]</p> <p>Concept used by existential philosophers to indicate a way of being in the world that confronts what it means to be human. </p> <p>[!col] Autonomy </p> <p>[!col-md-3]</p> <p>From auto (meaning \"self\") and nomos (meaning \"law\"), typically understood to mean \"self-legislating,\" but can have very different meanings depending on whether \"self\" is understood to be only the rational self (as in Kant) or the desiring self (as in everyday usage).</p> <p>[!col] Determinism</p> <p>[!col-md-3]</p> <p>Philosophical position that hcaused by someone or something other than that individual.</p> <p>[!col] Dualism</p> <p>[!col-md-3]</p> <p>Philosophical position that holds that reality is actually composed of two separate realities, most often associated with mind/body dualism, or the dividsion of mental reality from physical reality. </p> <p>[!col] Epistemology</p> <p>[!col-md-3]</p> <p>Area of philosophy that deals with questions about what is and is not knowable (e.g. What is knowledge?

By 2007 this has risen to the equivalent of 174 (!) newspapers. </p> <p>This increase in volume of information is what creates the sensation of the world speeding up. </p> <p>Humans love the speed: we feel connected to the whole world and we like to feel that we can look up any topic on anything that's happening in the world right now, and learn about it. But we also told ourselves that we would handle this massive expansion of amount of information we are exposed to, at the speed of which it hits us with no costs. This is a delusion. In fact, it becomes exhausting, and more importantly, what we are sacrificing is depth in all sorts of dimensions.  Depth takes time. And depth takes reflection. If you have to keep up with everything and send email (be online) all the time, there's no time to reach depth. Depths connected to your work in your relationships also takes time. It takes energy, it takes long time spans. And it takes commitment. It requires attention. All of these things that require depth are suffering. It's pulling us more and more up to the surface. </p> <p>A metaphor for the future </p> <p>![[Pasted image 20240614002628.png]] To quote Sune Lehmann: There will be an upper class of people who are very aware of the risks to their attention and find ways to live within their limits, and then there will be the rest of the society with fewer resources to resist the manipulation, and they're going to be living more and more inside their computers, being manipulated. </p> <p>In general, humans want to take the easy way out, but what makes us happy is doing the thing that is a little bit difficult. What's happening with our cellphones is that we put a thing that's in our pocket that's with us all the time which always offers an easy thing to do, rather than the important thing.\"</p> <p>Sune said; \"I wanted to vie myself a chance at choosing something that's more difficult.\"</p> <p>Instead of acknowledging our limitations, and trying to live within them, we, as society have -en masse- fallen for an enormous delusion: the myth that wee can actually think about three, five, ten things at the same time. We took a term meant for computers and applied it to ourselves. They called this machine power multi tasking. </p> <p>But humans aren't machines, we don't work that way. We don't multitask, instead we are \"juggling\": we switch back and forth. We don't notice it because our brain of papers it over, so we feel like it's a seamless experience of consciousness, but what we're actually doing is switching and 'reconfiguring' our brains from moment to moment - task to taks - an operation that comes with a cost:  1. Time lost: When we switch between tasks, we don't only lose the time spent on the new task (i.e checking the text message); but we also lose the time it takes for our brain to get back on track. This might take longer than the time you spent checking the text.  2. The screw-up effect: Human brains are error-prone. And when you switch from task to task, your brain has to backtrack a little bit to figure out where you left off before you can pick it back up, but brains can't do that 100% perfectly. This is why you'll start making little mistakes and then you'll have to spend extra time to correct them.  3. The creativity drain. It's something you only notice in the medium or longer term. Our brain need time to process in put and connect them in new ways in a process that happens at the level beneath the conscious mind, but if you constantly spend the time switching tasks, error-correcting and giving it input, the brain is given less time to follow the associative links down to new ideas.  4. The diminished memory effect. This has a smaller amount of evidence, but what it essentially shows is that if y ou do multiple things at the same time, you don't remember what you had done as well as if you only did one task at a time. This seems to be because it takes mental space and energy to convert your experiences into memories, and if you are spending your energy switching very fast, you'll remember and learn less. </p> <p>According to author Robert Calville we're living in \"the Great Acceleration\", but more speed means less comprehension. There is a maximum limit for how quickly humans can absorb information, and trying to bust through that barrier simply busts your brain's ability to understand it instead. </p> <p>However, because load of information is so massive, Johann Hari wonders if we are now, in some ways, increasingly speed-reading life, skimming hurriedly from one thing to another, while we absorb less and less. </p>"},{"location":"Zettelkasten/Reading%20Notes/Non-Fiction/Hari%2C%20Johann/Stolen%20Focus/#notable-names_1","title":"Notable names","text":"<p>\u2014List of Names worthy of checking out later\u2014 -
