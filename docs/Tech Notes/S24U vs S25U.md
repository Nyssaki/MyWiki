Important note! S-pen no longer have bluetooth functionality, meaning it cannot be used as a remote control for camera. -> This is important for photography on tripod

One UI7 Android 15 to both devices.

S25U seems to have better display, and sleeker design. 

But! Is this trade off worth it? 

The other actual bigger problem: S25 does not have expandable storage, Samsung has removed this capability. 

At this point, they're getting a lot of users coming from Apple, but for someone like me, I agree with those who said that S24 Ultra probably would be my last Samsung phone, unless this changes in future models.

The problem is that I don't actually have any proper alternative when buying from a carrier. I will stick with the S24 ultra for the time being, but I will have to see what I will do before my leasing is done early next year.
