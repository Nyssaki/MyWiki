~~Workflow for study idea: import pdf/any digital text to notewise for annotating while reading -> import annoated pdf to Obsidian -> take notes in Obsidian with linkback (is this the right term?) to the annotated pdf : Obsidian doesn't work well with embedding big pdf files.tewise for annotating while reading -> import annoated pdf to Obsidian -> take notes in Obsidian with linkback (is this the right term?) to the annotated pdf : Obsidian doesn't work well with embedding big pdf files.

**<u>New workflow:</u>** annotate pdfs in notewise -> write notes in Obsidian when necessary

- [ ] PDF annotator plugin
- [ ] Test plugin 

For writing: 
- [ ] Longform: Understand scenes the way it's meant here
- [ ] Longform: export formats and howto


So far: 
- Imported from Notion -> can uninstall app.  
- Created folder for Notes -> these are simple notes, so no longer needs Samsung Notes nor do I need any other 3rd party apps 
- Pandoc: .md to .pdf is done
