status: In Progress

- [x] Create GitHub account
- [x] Get node.js v18.14+ (check version using node -v)
- [x] Get NPM v9.3.1+ (check version using npm -v)
- [x] Git (check version using git â€“version)
- [x] Clone quartz repo
- For ignoring specific folders when pushing to git: 
		- [ ] Install Obsidian Export 
		- [ ] Install Obsidian Hugo
		- [ ] Clone Obsidian Export repo
		- [ ] Clone Obsidian Hugo repo

Ideally I'd like to publish only Zettelkasten, Language Hub, Tech Notes and the longform, finished version of my writing (which might be it's own folder outside the WIP one I guess)...
