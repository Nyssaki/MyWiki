"Annotator taking too long to load" error and it doesn't handle big pdf files very well  â€” crashes when the document is over 500 pages. 

There are probably other pdf plugin's I could use, but rather, I have decided to use Notewise to annotate the pdf's and then write the notes in Obsidian for review purposes etc. 

So the current workflow for pdfs: annotate in Notewise -> notes in Obsidian -> might export to pdf later for review later if needed, or just review in Obsidian.
