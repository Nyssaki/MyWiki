Main purpose for TextMaker: long form writing, and perhaps export to PDF / ePub. 

- Can use Obsidian for long form writing
- Export to PDF? Obisidian is MD, so need to convert to pdf or ePub. 
- ~~Calibre -> would need to use desktop~~ 
- Ideally something I can use directly from tablet (Pandoc?)

Conclusion: Pandoc/pdflatex .md -> pdf conversion works flawlessly. This means I do not need TextMaker anymore.
