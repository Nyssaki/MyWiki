## Notes

- The single most devastating thing about this book was not Neil’s death nor the firing of Mr.Keating, both which I already knew before beginning the book. It is the quiet heartbreak of Todd unveiling his poem, the evening the The Dead Poet’s Society were celebrating Neil’s triumph on the stage. Knowing that he’d worked on the poem all semester; refusing to even show Neil any of it, knowing, that Neil was the one who pulled Todd into not just the society, but also the world around them. Knowing, that apart from Mr.Keating, Neil was probably the first and only person who’d truly shown Todd interest and care; and that, albeit their friends were genuinely surprised and in awe at Todd’s poetry, Neil would be the only one who’d truly understand it. Todd was coming out of his shell, his cocoon while Neil was dying. There’s a poetic irony to this.

## Key takeaways

## Quotes

> But only in their dreams can men be truly free. John Keating.

> Medicine, law, business, engineering. These are noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love. These are what we stay alive for.
