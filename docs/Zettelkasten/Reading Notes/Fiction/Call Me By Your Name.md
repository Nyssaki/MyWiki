## SUMMARY

“During a restless summer on the Italian Riviera, a powerful romance blooms between seventeen-year-old Elio and his father’s house guest, Oliver. Unrelenting currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire threaten to overwhelm the lovers who at first feigh indidfference to the charge between them. What grows from the depths of their souls is a romance of scarcely six weeks’ duration, and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing they both already fear they may never truly find gain: total intimacy.”

  

## SYMBOLS

Meaning of the colors of Olivers’ bathing shorts, according to Elio:

- Red: “_bold, set in his ways, very grown-up, almost gruff and ill-tempered—stay away”_
- Yellow: “_sprightly, buoyant, funny, not without barbs—don’t give in too easily; might turn to red in no time”_
- Green: _“acquiescent, eager to learn, eager to speak, sunny—why wasn’t he always like this”_
- Blue: whenever he has shown Elio affection.



“[…] I lay there, watching him smile in a way that made me fear anything might happen now and there’d be no turning back, that this was his way of asking, and here was my chance to say no or to say something and play for time, so that I might still debate the matter with myself, now that it had reached this point,” he notes. This kind of wavering between desire and hesitancy is the direct result of Elio’s inexperience—having never ventured into these territories with a man, let alone an adult, he realizes there will be “no turning back” once he moves forward. In other words, he hasn’t had enough sexual or romantic experiences to know with confidence exactly what he wants. By spotlighting this indecision, Aciman shows readers the complicated calculations involved in relationships between adults and minors, which are naturally unbalanced because one party lacks experience and the other does not.
