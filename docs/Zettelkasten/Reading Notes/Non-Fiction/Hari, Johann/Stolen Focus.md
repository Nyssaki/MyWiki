### Quotes (Reference Notes)


> 	"I wondered if the motto for our era should be: I tried to live, but I got distracted"


> 	"It felt like our civilisation had been covered with itching powder, and we spent our time twitching and twerking our minds, unable to simply give attention to things that matter"

> 	 "We need to ask if we are now developing an 'attentional pathogenic culture' -- an environment in which sustained and deep focus is extremely hard for all of us, and you have to swim upstream to achieve it."

### Summary(Literature Notes)

Key take away: Author believes that the worsening of our attention is not only due to personal reasons but are also the result of forces beyond each of us. He says parts of it comes from Big Tech companies, but even they only play a part. Johann Hari calls this a systemic problem, which we, as human race needs to reframe in order to be able to solve it -- and he claims to have found both the sources of where the problem lies and the solution to our problems. (Personal note: the latter is a **big** claim).

### Quotes (Reference Notes)

> 	“We cannot put off living until we are ready. The most salient characteristic of life is its coerciveness: it is always urgent, ‘here and now,’ without any postponement. Life is fired at us point-blank.” —José Ortega y Gasset

>	"The you that exist in the present - right now - wants to pursue your deeper goals, and wants to be a better person. But you know you're fallible and likely to crack in the face of temptation. So you bind the future version of you. You narrow your choices."

>	For so long I had been fixing my gaze on things that were very fast and very temporary, like a Twitter feed. When you fix your gaze on the speedy, you feel pensive, amped up, liable to be washed away if you don't move, wave, shout. Now I found myself staring at something very old and very permanent. ... Twitter makes you feel that the whole world is obsessed with you and your little ego - it loves you, it hates you, it's talking about you *right now*. 

>	"It's when you set aside your distractions, he said, that you begin to see what you were distracting yourself from."

>	"Slowness nurtures attention and speed shatters it."

>	"We have to shrink the world to fit our cognitive bandwidth."


### Summary(Literature Notes)

Key takeaways: 
- The acceleration of the society and decline in collective attention span
- The proof of this claim in various studies related to how long topics and new concepts/terms are discussed for
- Fundamental limitations of the human brain; mono tasking, mental bandwidth
- The myth of multi-tasking 
- Three ways the belief in multi-tasking harms human focus: task switching, the "screw-up" effect, the creativity drain (plus a fourth less researched called the diminished memory effect)
- The prefrontal cortex as brain's bouncer, the overload caused by issues like rising noise in our daily environment (noise pollution)
- In addition to switching tasks in a higher speed and volume than previously, the prefrontal cortex also has to filter out more noise - this is what leads to mental exhaustion

### Further Notes

Sune Lehmann launched a research to answer a key question: Is our collective attention span really shrinking? They answered this question by tracking and analyzing how long people collectively talk about a topic from various media, Twitter, Google search, Reddit. They compared the time to the recent past years, they also compared this to the data from Google Books, to see how long the trend has been happening. The result were that in every system, there's an accelerating trend. 

One way of thinking about this, Sune said, is that at the moment, it is like we're "drinking from a fire-hose - there's too much coming at us." We're soaked in information. 

To put it more bluntly: picture reading a eighty-five-page-newspaper. In 1986, if you added upu all the information being blasted at the average human being: TV, radio, reading, it would amount to forty newspapers-worth of information every day. By 2007 this has risen to the equivalent of 174 (!) newspapers. 

*This increase in volume of information is what creates the sensation of the world speeding up.* 

Humans love the speed: we feel connected to the whole world and we like to feel that we can look up any topic on anything that's happening in the world right now, and learn about it. But we also told ourselves that we would handle this massive expansion of amount of information we are exposed to, at the speed of which it hits us with no costs. This is a delusion. In fact, it becomes exhausting, and more importantly, what we are *sacrificing is depth in all sorts of dimensions*.  Depth takes time. And depth takes reflection. If you have to keep up with everything and send email (be online) all the time, there's no time to reach depth. Depths connected to your work in your relationships also takes time. It takes energy, it takes long time spans. And it takes commitment. It requires attention. All of these things that require depth are suffering. It's pulling us more and more up to the surface. 

**A metaphor for the future** 

![[Pasted image 20240614002628.png]]
To quote Sune Lehmann: There will be an upper class of people who are very aware of the risks to their attention and find ways to live within their limits, and then there will be the rest of the society with fewer resources to resist the manipulation, and they're going to be living more and more inside their computers, being manipulated. 

In general, humans want to take the easy way out, but what makes us happy is doing the thing that is a little bit difficult. What's happening with our cellphones is that we put a thing that's in our pocket that's with us all the time which always offers an easy thing to do, rather than the important thing."

Sune said; "I wanted to vie myself a chance at choosing something that's more difficult."

Instead of acknowledging our limitations, and trying to live within them, we, as society have -en masse- fallen for an enormous delusion: the myth that wee can actually think about three, five, ten things at the same time. We took a term meant for computers and applied it to ourselves. They called this machine power multi tasking. 

But humans aren't machines, we don't work that way. We don't multitask, instead we are "juggling": we switch back and forth. We don't notice it because our brain of papers it over, so we feel like it's a seamless experience of consciousness, but what we're actually doing is switching and 'reconfiguring' our brains from moment to moment - task to taks - an operation that comes with a cost: 
1. Time lost: When we switch between tasks, we don't only lose the time spent on the new task (i.e checking the text message); but we also lose the time it takes for our brain to get back on track. This might take longer than the time you spent checking the text. 
2. The screw-up effect: Human brains are error-prone. And when you switch from task to task, your brain has to backtrack a little bit to figure out where you left off before you can pick it back up, but brains can't do that 100% perfectly. This is why you'll start making little mistakes and then you'll have to spend extra time to correct them. 
3. The creativity drain. It's something you only notice in the medium or longer term. Our brain need time to process in put and connect them in new ways in a process that happens at the level beneath the conscious mind, but if you constantly spend the time switching tasks, error-correcting and giving it input, the brain is given less time to follow the associative links down to new ideas. 
4. The diminished memory effect. This has a smaller amount of evidence, but what it essentially shows is that if y ou do multiple things at the same time, you don't remember what you had done as well as if you only did one task at a time. This seems to be because it takes mental space and energy to convert your experiences into memories, and if you are spending your energy switching very fast, you'll remember and learn less. 

According to author Robert Calville we're living in "the Great Acceleration", but more speed means less comprehension. There is a maximum limit for how quickly humans can absorb information, and trying to bust through that barrier simply busts your brain's ability to understand it instead. 

However, because load of information is so massive, Johann Hari wonders if we are now, in some ways, increasingly speed-reading life, skimming hurriedly from one thing to another, while we absorb less and less.
