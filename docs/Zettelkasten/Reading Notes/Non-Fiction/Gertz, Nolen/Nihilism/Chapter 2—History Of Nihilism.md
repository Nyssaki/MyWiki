  - History Of Nihilism
---
In this chapter, Gertz presents a curated list of philosophers dating back to ancient Greece who, despite not being the one's using the phrase *nihilism* themselves, were among those whose arguments has since become the foundation of what is known as nihilism today. 

The word nihilism itself dates back to 18th Century, to debates that took place among German philosophers over the implications of the metaphysics of Enlightenment. However, Gertz notes that the history of what nihilism represents can be trace back even further, and he that indeed Socrates himself was not only the father of philosophy, but also the father of self-righteousness. 

Indeed, Socrates would ask Athenians to define concepts that were central to everyday life, such as love, honour, piety, knowledge and justice. However, once a fellow Athenian gave him an answer, Socrates would test the definition given to him. He would not only challenge the Athenians to prove that what they believed to be true could actually withstand any and all attempts at refutation but also challenge them to admit that their beliefs were false if Socrates refutations were successful. In other words, Nolen writes, that Socrates went beyond merely trying to engage members of society in debate, as he was trying to force Athenians to questions the beliefs their society was built upon; to question whether their society was based on the solid foundation of knowledge or on dubious [[Studying nihilism—mental health#2025 and this hasn't changed | foundations like custom and opinion]].

### <u>Socrates' Cave</u>

Nolen's re-telling of the history of nihilism begins with Socrates' Cave: In Book VII, Socrates paints humans as prisoners who have been trapped in an underground cave since birth, with nothing to experience, nothing to learn and nothing to talk about; other than shadows. After describing this kind of life, Socrates declares: "they are like us!".

He challenges his readers to seriously consider that everything they think they know about reality is an illusion. We are like the prisoners underground cave not only because *we accept as reality whatever we have grown accustomed to* but *also because, having grown accustomed to this reality, we would reject any challenge to this reality that was presented to us*. 

Nolen makes an argument that Socrates wants us to realise that we are *nihilistic* because Socrates maintains *seeing is believe but also that believing is rejecting*. 

According to Nolen, nihilism is a danger both epistemologically and existentially from a Socratic perspective — Socrates argues that the prisoners would not only continue to believe in shadows even if counterevidence was provided to them but would kill anyone who brought them this counterevidence; anyone who tried to convince them that their beliefs were false, anyone who tried to liberate them from their prison. The prisoners, not knowing that the are prisoners, would not see the cave as prison, but as home – just as the prisoners would not see the person who wants to take them out of the cave as *a liberator* but as a madman. 

Looking back at history, you could say Socrates was right, as he was accused by the greater Athenian society of being a heretic and a dangerous corruptor of the youth. One of the accusations Socrates faced was that he never put forward his own beliefs and instead merely [[Studying nihilism—mental health#Asking questions equals attacking beliefs | tried to attack the belief of others]].

There's this famous story of Socrates being told by the Oracle of Delphi that he, indeed was the wisest man of Athens because *he alone knew that he knew nothing*. Socrates' interlocutors likened him to a torpedo fish, a creature which numbs anyone who comes into contact with it; however Socrates instead likens himself to a gadfly and a midwife: suggesting that his purpose is not to confuse but to motivate and to help. 

He weakens people's certainty in their beliefs not to be evil but to inspire others to replace their beliefs with knowledge. As he himself says during his trial: "the unexamined life is not worth living". Socrates would rather die than to be sentenced to a life where his prohibited from asking questions in such manner. 

Nolen argues that Socrates embodies many of the characteristics of what's known as an anti-nihilist today, by eroding not only their faith in what they believe to be true but also in what they believe truth to be. He wanted people to be inspired by him, even those who comes to conclusions more radial than those of himself.
