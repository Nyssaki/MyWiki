  Studying nihilism
---

1. Existential Nihilism: No intrinsic meaning to life. 
2. Moral Nihilism: No objective moral truths
3. Epistemological Nihilism: Skepticism about the possibility of knowledge 
4. Political Nihilism: Rejection of societal structures/authority

- Nihilism is a lens; not a doctrine — it's goal is to question assumptions that rarely offer solutions
- Many philosophers saw it as a catalyst for **reimagining values**
- Cricisms highlight its psychological and societal risks but often conflate nihilism with pessimism

*The very fact that a general problem has gripped and assimilated the whole of a person is a guarantee that the speaker has really experienced it, and perhaps gained something from his sufferings. He will then reflect the problem for us in his personal life and thereby show us a truth.* —Carl Jung

How is existential despair *not* the same as a depression? Or at least, to an extent, a version of depression? Considering depression is not a "one size fits all" nor is there ever a clear-cut definition of what may be the causality of depression for someone. 

<u><b>Causality</b></u>: the relationship between cause / effect
Note: you can be successful and still be depressed.
How then, but this could also be existential despair? If you're not happy with the life you've be built, despite what is seemingly successful (perhaps because you've used other people's gauge on *what's successful*) then it could be argued as existential despair. 

It can be argued that said hypothetical person is displaying *nihilistic behavior* if they then chose to continue with their life and dig their head deeper into the situation instead of making changes to it. As nihilism asks you to confront your "demons" and come out on the other side with some answers. Or does this only apply to moral questions and not practical everyday life situations? 

"The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."  —Albert Camus

### note: 
but has it though? We still have the protestors who will shout with megaphones in malls; and this leads to another confusion about Gertz' definition of the self-righteous: which is that of someone who's primarily nihilistic themselves. However, modern society shows that these self-righteous often has their beliefs they want others to convert to? –> The nihilating tendencies practiced by the self-righteous in the examples of a vegan: ignoring the blatant financial privelege it is to be able to pick what kind of food you eat and be able to afford supplements for the inevitable imbalance in nutrition.



## Nihilism is to avoid existential despair 
by outsourcing meaning to extensitial systems, ideologies or identities: This includes the self–righteous in form of climate or vegan activists due to their *mode of engagement*. They reduces others to "evil" for not complying with their beliefs, but do not consider how the beliefs would affect the others. (Would the poor actually be able to afford high-end vegan lifestyle, which in some countries are arguably more expensive? What good does the climate protester even achieve then they block the way for the simply man who's only concern is to get to work so they don't get fired and can make a living?)


## Performative self-righteousness
It is when self-righteousness becomes *performative outrage* that the self-righteous show themselves as nihilistic. It is not that they believe in nothing or do nothing, it is that they are reducing others (or what others believe or do) to *nothing* in order to avoid their own exitential despair — the despair which would be the result of questioning one's own role: "I fight for the rights of animals, but I am still part of the problem". Instead the self-righteous think: "I fight for the rights of animals, hence I am morally superior and better than the evil humans who still consume animal product.")

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the entire purpose of anti-nihilism as a concept. 

Concept of self-righteousness and nihilism does explain a lot of issues I have when conversion with new age woke people. The ones who are incredibly "passionate"—sometimes perhaps to the point of obsessive—of their beliefs that they become extremists. They don't see any faults in their exstremism, nor do they see any error in their activism, but critisizes others extremism. I.e the vegan protester who yells at the meat section in a supermarket or the one who strips off their clothes on a local fish market to get attention. The latter have zero consideration for the people—the fishermen—trying to make a living out of a dying way of life. Fishing, prior to modern society was for surival, and the harsh reality of being a fisherman compared to a priveleged blond woman walking around advocating/shaming others not to eat fish because *she* thinks the others are harming the animals, paints a rather ridiculous picture of activism and would only turn people against the protester. 

Note: the problem is reduced to shouting with megaphones in malls; and this leads to another confusion about Gertz' definition of the self-righteous which is that of someone who's primarily nihilistic themselves. However, modern society shows that these self-righteous often has their beliefs they want others to convert to. 

Note: the problem is reducing complex issues to simplistic binaries ("good vs evil"). 


Other topics to discuss in relation to this: feminism, racism, woke culture in general, modern activism (like the climate activist who claim the only way to draw attention to their cause is to damage paintings that are hundreds of years old).

## Questioning the status quo.
The irony in that being countercultural is not a niche anymore but is now being embraced by the culture. 

In other words, it is *in* to be rebellious and to question the morality that's held be majority of society-

## Plato and Arendt on political freedom
Still struggling to understand how Plato equals political freedom to freedom. Why is participation in politics even regardes as freedom, and not any other means, or why is it the only metric of freedom? Freedom is for the few and powerful?

## Reasons to write in the current trend of "bad" literature
I'm wondering if nihilism is somehow the argument I have been missing when it comes to my issues whether or not it is worth writing in a society where everything thinks they are an author and where everybody think they have a masterpiece novel at every corner (which they somehow have the right to earn money from and utilise AI in the process to do so but at the same time claim the work is theirs?)

## 2025 and this hasn't changed 
Socrates must be turning in his grave — i.e the way the current US President has been selcted. 

## Asking questions equals attacking beliefs
This is a "accusation" that's baffling me. In a productive argument, discussion of any topic, isn't it the point of the interviewer (or the conversational partner) to be a sounding board, someone object who questions the other person, someone who challenges the other with the difficult questions no one has asked before. What would it matter what *I* personally felt about the topic? If we were discussing my point of view on something, then sure — fire away all the questions you have and make me explain myself. But we aren't. We are talking about yours, the conversation partner. Usually because they are the ones who enjoys talking about themselves, they enjoy to speak more than they enjoy listening anyway. 

So as to then, accuse me of being "heretic" because I don't put forward a view which corresponds with their beliefs, is... something I do not understand and probably won't understand; not even with the knowledge (hah!) of Socrate's cave explanation in mind. Well, I understand perhaps a little bit more, and somehow it presents itself a new challenge I'm not sure has been discussed in Socrate's works, and especially in modern times: the consideration whether or not it is *ethical* to try and upset the beliefs these people have of their reality. 

I know it's one thing to ponder one's responsibility (to whom, other than oneself, perhaps?) to "enlighten" the world around us, but considering we're also studying one of the most complex topics of philosophy: nihilism, I wonder if a breach in the belief would rather throw most people into the deep end instead of helping them.

There's something called "ignorance is a bliss" and perhaps, that for *most* people, that's the best way of living life. (God, I sound like the enlightenment philsophers: "this is not for the *sheep*!")

## Trip To Infinity
I remember one of the subjects in the documentary Trip To Infinity mentioned something re feeling the meaninglessness of life when they studied infinity (I'm of course paraphrasing here, out of memory), I think the person said something about how meaningless everything felt, but that when he fell in love everything meant something. I think that is a silly way of looking at it—I don't think you can change overnight the way you look at meaninglessness in the universe and suddenly say; "oooh so this is meaning of life!", especially if you haven't experienced or considered other meaning of life (unless they have and the interview just didn't have the room to deepdive). Life in and of itself is meaningless, and meaning is what we make of it. I think this person created meaning out of love because he needed life to mean something. 

Meaning is then—like many other major aspects of life—a construct made up by society. 

However, the problem I'm feeling might not necessarily be this fact, but rather, that the meaning which is often constructed by society doesn't make sense to me; as if, meaning itself doesn't mean anything sensible. There's a slight irony in this, but think of it this way. Capitalism has been the core value western society has been raised under for the past fifty or so years? And while we've lived through the birth of it, it's peek hour and now, arguably is living through it's downfall—we may have been swimming in materialistic wealth, but what can we say about the rest of our society? The rapid rise of *decline* in mental health: where around every corner there seems to be a comedian joking about medication, or another headline about the loneliness epidemic, and the speed which our financial freedom disintegrates/erodes with each day due to the inflation. We are joking about how everything is "giving recession" to use a 2025-appropriate term, but we fail to see past the grief of a picture perfect lifestyle burning in flames and direct our anger towards rich people (who apparently are the oppresors and the reason for this disaster). As if; the choices to take out all those credit card loan were made by them. As if every purchase done in the name of fashion wasn't done by ourselves, but somehow there were someone there with us, pointing a gun at our head thus forcing us to buy the items.
