### The irony of being rich and still wishing for suicide
 Camus writes that while Schopenhauer is often cited as a fit subject for laughter because he praised suicide while seated at a well-set table, this is no subject for joking; rather it is a way of judging a man. This correlates to the modern society's belief that "money solves all problems" and the rejection of the idea that rich people cannot have any struggles and must be living on rosey lives. It is one thing to wish for the bank account of rich even though you know you'll be depressed nonetheless, it's another to think the money would solve your problems (or depression). We know money can solve *some* problems. There has even been extensive research which shows that money—up to a certain amount—does help alleviate a lot of problems for most people. Yet, the same researches show that any amount of money above that only provides more problems. I don't understand why this is a thing humans would want for themselves? 

### Find meaning in others
Why is this an advice, when it's been proven quite often that when the *other* is being taken away, a lot of people aren't able to handle the grief. When you're not living for yourself, but others, this is the only logical outcome — if grief doesn't consume you to the point you refuse life, many still are consumed by the grief in a way which their life never move forward in a sense. It is as if the life stopped the moment the other were taken away from them. This is visible in parents who lost a child and am unable to i.e change the room they lived in and keep them this way the day they lost them. 

It appears also in the way that was portrayed in *The Arrow* tv-show, when the son was found after five years and the doctor says to the mother: "the boy you lost might not be the boy who returned"; the implications being that the doctor has seen many cases like this where parents expects such a thing to be the result. They hope and act as if nothing has changed the years that were gone by, when the person who had been missing changed so much that they probably wouldn't be able to accept the new version of their son. 

And in the case of the show *The Arrow*, the boy who was missing, Oliver, seemed to pretended to be the boy he was before he went missing. He behaved the way people expected of him—but we, as audience—saw the difference. 

How suffocating that must have felt! 

### Absurd love.
We're somehow conditioned to think that love means something. I spoke briefly of this in[[Studying nihilism—mental health#Trip To Infinity| Love as meaning]], and I feel this is part of absurditity. No one can explain what love truly is, and yet, we place our entire beings on the concept, the idea, of love. We see this in literature, religion, history. Wars were fought because of love and jealousy, real wars where millions have lost their lives; people taking their own lives when love was lost, etc. If you collect all of literature that has been dedicated to love or were sprung out of love, it seems to me to be the map of a collective illness. 

Because for most part, we don't have very good reason to fall in love with somebody. It's always described as a look, a touch or just a few words said in a situation or place where you didn't expect it, and people then runs off chasing that *other* and risking their entire lives for it. 

And yet, we often end up fall *out of* love with the same person for the same reasons we fell in love with them. There's some sort of poetic irony in this. 

Humans is said to thrive on the chase, rather than when they achieve the goal, it seems to bleed over to the realm as well. We love the thrill of not knowing whether or not the other is thinking of us, of whether or not the other saw our message and then cry in agony when we're left "on read" (or in olden times, the many ways a letter could be lost but the result were the same). 

The heart always wants what it can't get, and prefers the insanity of not knowing over the stability of having, *and* knowing. Because *knowing* removes the mystery, it brings with it the truth behind the veil and sometimes we aren't prepared for that; we had, during the chase constructed an entire image of the other, that are oftentimes alot better than reality. 

Reality it seems, are always grey and boring, so we chase a mirage, something ghost-like. And then gets surprised when the picture perfect ghost we chased became all too real. 

And we don't want the reality when it hits us in the face. We want the fairytale we had constructed in our minds. 

What then—if the question of suicide is the most important—is more absurd than love? 

### Absurd Walls
Feeling of absurdity is elusive; how? In my experience it is a constant. Elusive as in the answers are or the feeling of absurdity itself? 

### Comment: 
- Is the conflict between logic and irrationality the question of suicide rises which Camus' calls absurdity, or is it that life is absurd in the sense that there isn't an inherent meaning to life. Camus quote: "The mind, when it reaches its limits, must make a judgement and choose its conclusions". 
- The virtue is in the disproportion between his intention and the reality he will encounter, and within the contradiction Camus' says he will notice the man's true strength and aim he has in view. 
- The life is absurd, and it has no meaning; hence I creating the meaning by chasing after the impossible. 

### Absurd contradiction, an example: 
The absurd has meaning only in so far as it is *not* agreed to, anedoctal example: I find life absurd, but never stops chasing a meaning. Yet I have not defined what meaning is and I canot bring myself to agree with the absurd, despite the fact that I find life trulig absurd. If I could only agree with the idea that life is absurd, I'd shrug the rest off of my shoulders and then continue living and stops asking any further questions about it. So yes, Camus is right that the absurd has meaning only when you don't agree with it. 

Is then perhaps that meaning in life for me is not the usual materialistic things but am I somehow doomed to find meaning in the meaningless—and live a life in utter irrational, contradictive absurdity? Which, if you ask Camus', is also only absurd becase of comparison. I compare my life to others, who seem to live a more "normal" life and hence wonder why i can't be similar to them. I look at my friends who settle down and think, that would bore me to hell and it would be true torture; yet I cannot shake the voice in my mind which says: but why can't you just be a little more like them? Why not make life easier for yourself, when it is already hard? – Because there's no meaning in the simple. When Camus' said the answer is simple but not at the same time. 

<I>"It is a matter of living in this state of the absurd I know on what it is founded, this mind and this world straining against each other without being able to embrace each other"</i>: a random jump to the movie, Eternal Summer, with Shane and Jonathan. "The Earth circles the Sun but cannot approach it." It is two opposites that are so strong that they will destroy each other if you attempt to reconcile the two, because the only way to reconcile them would be to change one of the two and thus make irreversible damage to their soul (they will not be the same person after the change and it will then forever taint their being). This is the <u>absurd tragedy</u>: For them to be together, one of them has to be destroyed. 

<u>Philosophical suicide</u>: not an actual suicide, but mere surrender to a leap of faith (so to speak). Camus' argues that a determined soul will always manage and hence not bow to the pressure of throwing aside intellect and the equilibrium of absurd in order to fit into an arbitrary solution that the seeker latch onto.
