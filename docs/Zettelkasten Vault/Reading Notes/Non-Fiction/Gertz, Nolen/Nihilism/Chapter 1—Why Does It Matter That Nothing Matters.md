<center>"I Honor Nihilism"</center>

> Nihilism is the righteous and honorable resistance of a people crushed under an iron rule. Nihilism is evidence of life ... The last weapon of victims choked and manacoled beyond all other resistance."  
> *—Wendell Philips*


Nihilism is one of those concepts that we are all pretty sure we know the meaning of unless someone asks us to define it. 

*Nihil* means "nothing" *-ism* means "ideology".

Combining these two terms gives "ideaology of ntohing", which seemingly seems to refute itself. To say that this means someone "believes in nothing" is not really much more helpful; as believing in something suggests there is something to be believed in, but if that *something* is *nothing* then there is not something to be believed in (in which case, believing in nothing is again a self-refuting idea).

<center>Doing Nothing</center>

> The question is this: What have I been doing? Everybody says to me, "Hey you don't do the show anymore, what do you do?" I'll tell you waht I do: Nothing. Doing Nothing is not as easy as it looks. You have to be careful. Because the idea of doing anything, which could easily lead to doing something, that would cut into **your** nothing, and that would force me to have to drop everything." *—Jerry Seinfeld*

*Nothingness* quickly becomes *somethingness* as soon as we try to talk about it; and yet we talk about it all the time. "What have you been up to?" - "Nothing." Exchanges like this are so common that it has become something of a reflex, as we frequently respond to such mundane questions. 

To most people an answer like this would not be an example of nihilism, since nihilism is suposed to be something dark, something negative, something *destructive*.  Saying you're doing nothing, is perfectly normal because everyone knows that you are not literally *doing nothing*, but are ==simply indicating that you are doing nothing worth mentioning==. 

However, if humans have these sorts of exchanges as frequently as indicated in the book by Nolen Gertz, Nolen states that that must mean we are frequently spending our time doing nothing worth mentioning. 

And if humans were actually spending so much time doing nothing worth mentioning, then perhaps this exchange is closer to what nihilism actually is. Nolen Gertz states that perhaps this does indicate that our lives are not worth mentioning, that we are doing nothing with our lives; that we are nothing, that we *believe in nothing*.

<u>To believe in nothing </u>

To believe in nothing in this sense would then require not that we have a specific believe about nothingness that we could identify, but instead that we are living lives that accord with the belief that *life is nothing*.

<u>Nihilism as an "ideology of nothing"</u> would mean not that e adhere to a discernible system of believes about nothingness, but rather that the beliefs we have, or think we have, are equivalent to nothing.

==<u>To be self-righteous</u> is to see what is normal, what is accepted, what is popular as nihilistic, as nothing, as meaningless.== *But to accuse others of being nihilistic is to be seen by those others as the oe who is truly nihilstic.* 

Note: there are *nihilating* tendencies practiced by the nihilists and there are the nihilating tendencies practiced by the self-righteous. 

How to explain this in simpler terms: if you complain that others have no meaning in their lives, because what they care about; i.e shopping or eating a very good meal, is nihislistic—*without meaning*— then this reveals yourself as the nihilistic one because you don't think anything beholds an inherent meaning. (Why is there confusion in this? This is probably more or less known to the nihilistic person themselves, which most likely might be the reason they are searching for one; or does Gertz mean to say that most nihilistic are unaware of it themselves? – which seems wrong to me considering Gertz stresses the importance of asking questions, but perhaps that's the anti-nihilstic behaviour he's looking for in the nihilistic.)

<u>Self-righteous vs nihilstic:</u> Both are similar insofar they are destructive, but they are opposed in the manner of methods and purpose of their desctructiveness:

The self-righteous often wages war with the general society, but such war are often short-lived, if they happen at all due to the mere fact that they would simply be ignored (or wiped out by the sheer numbers, as the self-righteous would be the part with lesser number). However, when the self-righteous discover that their confrontation seldom leads to the revolution they are hoping for, they'll turn to whatever media that are available to them: traditional media are replaced by social media and shouting ([ but has it though](Studying nihilism—mental health#note)).

Nolen Gertz postulates that "questioning the quo[ has become the status quo](Studying nihilism—mental health#Questioning the status quo )."

In a seemingly self-righteous society nihilists has therefore gained considerable popularity, and there's some comedic irony to this. Nihilism has then become a some sort of "charge" to be used against anyone who isn't supporting the right morale, but Gertz asks how this is possible when these two philisophies are seemingly on the opposite side of each other? Gertz concludes in this chapter that in doing so we might be taking meaningfulness for granted, and that to answer the question of what nihilism is; we have to leave open whether or not anything in life is actually *meaningful*.
