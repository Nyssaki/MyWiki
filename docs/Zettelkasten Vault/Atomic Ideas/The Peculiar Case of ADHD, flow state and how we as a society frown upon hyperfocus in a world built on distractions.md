Is the rise of ADHD due to actual under-diagnosis, or is it due to the changes in the way society is built and therefore fundamental changes in human life which disrupts our focus to the extent that we actually cannot focus anymore. 

We think of ourselves as computers (the myth of multitasking) and then treat animals like humans -- as beings you can treat with drugs to "take the edge off" behavior that doesn't fit into the modern life in a cage. 

The inherently entitled and priveleged way of thinking, a utopian notion for the upper class, that every human being should have the opportunity to fulfill their highest potential, that every human being has a right to find the meaning of life, that every human being are entitled to a form of self-realisation. 

But then I guess when you have reached the peak of financial security, this is the kind of existential problem that humans encounter -- refer Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. 

The irony of ADHD is that ADHDers work best during long uninterrupted hours while focused on one important task that is challenging / not boring, according to research this is the best state for most normal human beings, and yet this is labeled as an illness, because we cannot switch off at will to attend to tasks others has decided are more important to us (and therefore we are the problem)?
